# Project Title: SubTrack - Subscription Tracker

## Project Overview:

SubTrack is a simple subscription tracking app that helps users keep track of their monthly subscriptions (e.g., Netflix, Spotify, Gym, etc.), reminding them of upcoming payments and preventing unwanted auto-renewals.


## Key Features:

### User Authentication: Sign up/log in to save subscription data.

### Add & Manage Subscriptions: Users can enter the name, cost, and billing cycle of each subscription.

### Upcoming Payment Reminders: Notify users when a subscription renewal is coming up.

### Expense Summary: Display total monthly spending on subscriptions.

### Basic AI Insights (Optional): AI can analyze subscriptions and suggest ways to reduce costs (e.g., "Youâ€™re subscribed to 3 streaming services. Consider canceling one to save $X per month.").
